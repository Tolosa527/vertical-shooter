# Obstacle System Upgrade - Complete Guide

## What's Changed

Your obstacle system has been upgraded from static Sprite2D to dynamic AnimatedSprite2D with support for:
- **Multiple random sprites** per obstacle spawn
- **Your custom PNG files** (automatically detected)
- **Animated obstacles** (rotation, sprite cycling)
- **Different obstacle types** (asteroids, debris, crystals)
- **Auto-generated fallback sprites** if no PNGs provided

## Files Modified

- `scenes/objects/Obstacle.tscn` - Now uses AnimatedSprite2D
- `scripts/Obstacle.gd` - Complete rewrite with sprite randomization
- Added helper scripts for setup and testing

## How to Use Your PNG

### Method 1: Simple Single PNG (Recommended)
1. Place your PNG in: `res://assets/sprites/obstacle1.png`
2. Run the game - it will automatically use your PNG!

### Method 2: Multiple PNGs for Variety
```
res://assets/sprites/
├── obstacle1.png  (your main asteroid)
├── obstacle2.png  (different shaped rock)  
├── obstacle3.png  (debris piece)
└── obstacle4.png  (crystal formation)
```

### Method 3: Sprite Sheet (Advanced)
If your PNG contains multiple frames:
1. Place it as: `res://assets/sprites/obstacle_sheet.png`
2. Configure the AnimatedSprite2D in Godot editor
3. Set up frame animations manually

## Testing Your Setup

Run this script to test everything:
```
Tools > Execute Script > test_obstacle_system.gd
```

It will check:
- ✅ AnimatedSprite2D is properly configured
- ✅ Your PNG files are detected
- ✅ Fallback sprites are created if needed

## How It Works

1. **Obstacle spawns** → `setup_random_obstacle()` runs
2. **PNG Detection**: Automatically finds files named:
   - `obstacle*.png`
   - `*asteroid*.png` 
   - `*rock*.png`
3. **Random Selection**: Each obstacle uses a different sprite
4. **Animation**: Sprites slowly rotate as they move
5. **Collision**: Auto-adjusts collision size per sprite type

## Key Features

- **Zero configuration** - just drop your PNG in the folder
- **Automatic variety** - different sprites = different obstacles
- **Performance optimized** - sprites are loaded once, shared by all obstacles
- **Fallback system** - generates sprites if none provided
- **Type-based collision** - different sizes for different obstacle types

## Customization Options

Edit `Obstacle.gd` to customize:
- Animation speeds (`set_animation_speed()`)
- Collision sizes (`adjust_collision_for_type()`)
- Sprite categories (asteroid, debris, crystal)
- PNG detection patterns
- Fallback sprite generation

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Place your PNG as `res://assets/sprites/obstacle1.png`
- [ ] Run the test script to verify setup
- [ ] Launch the game and test obstacle spawning
- [ ] Add more PNGs for variety (optional)

## Advanced: Animated Obstacles

For spinning/animated obstacles:
1. Create sprite sheet with rotation frames
2. Configure SpriteFrames in Godot editor
3. Set animation speed in obstacle script

Your obstacles will now have visual variety and can use your custom artwork!
